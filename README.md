# Express-Typescript-Webpack-Starter

My own simple starter project for spinning up an Express api server with typescript and Webpack.

## Usage
---
Clone the repo

create a .env file with your env variables

example:
```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```
cd into the folder and run `yarn`

`yarn serve` to start the server in dev mode

`yarn build` bundle the app into dist folder

`yarn start` to start the server in production mode
